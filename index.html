    <h1>Privacy Policy for Flimmersive</h1>
    <p class="last-updated"><strong>Last updated:</strong> January 5, 2026</p>

    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>Flimmersive ("we", "our", or "the app") is committed to protecting your privacy. This Privacy Policy explains how Flimmersive handles information when you use our speed-reading application.</p>

    <h2>Data Collection</h2>
    <p><strong>Flimmersive does not collect, store, or transmit any personal information or user data to external servers.</strong> The app operates entirely on your device, and all data remains under your control.</p>

    <h2>Local Storage</h2>
    <p>The app stores the following data locally on your device:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Reading Preferences:</strong> Your customized settings including reading speed (WPM), words per display, font selection, font size, and theme preferences</li>
        <li><strong>Reading Progress:</strong> Current reading position, session history, and bookmarks for your documents</li>
        <li><strong>Imported Content:</strong> Documents and files you choose to import (EPUB, TXT, and other supported formats)</li>
        <li><strong>Reading Statistics:</strong> Local tracking of your reading sessions and progress (never shared externally)</li>
    </ul>
    <p>This data is stored exclusively on your device and is never uploaded to any server or shared with third parties. You can delete all data at any time by uninstalling the app.</p>

    <h2>File Access Permissions</h2>
    <p>Flimmersive requires permission to access files on your device for the following purposes:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Importing Documents:</strong> To allow you to select and import reading materials (EPUB books, text files, etc.)</li>
        <li><strong>Reading Content:</strong> To access and display the content of documents you have imported</li>
    </ul>
    <p>The app only accesses files that you explicitly select through the file picker. We do not scan, access, or collect any other files on your device.</p>

    <h2>Third-Party Services</h2>
    <p>Flimmersive does not integrate any third-party services, including:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>No analytics or tracking services</li>
        <li>No advertising networks</li>
        <li>No crash reporting services</li>
        <li>No social media integrations</li>
        <li>No cloud storage services</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Your reading activity and preferences remain completely private on your device.</p>

    <h2>Children's Privacy</h2>
    <p>Flimmersive does not knowingly collect any information from children. The app is designed for general audiences and operates entirely locally without any data collection.</p>

    <h2>Data Security</h2>
    <p>Since all data is stored locally on your device and never transmitted over the internet, your information is protected by your device's built-in security measures. We recommend:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Using device passcode/biometric authentication</li>
        <li>Keeping your device operating system up to date</li>
        <li>Being cautious about granting file access permissions</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Data Retention and Deletion</h2>
    <p>You have complete control over your data:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Reading Progress:</strong> Can be cleared through the app settings</li>
        <li><strong>Imported Documents:</strong> Can be removed individually within the app</li>
        <li><strong>All Data:</strong> Completely removed by uninstalling the app from your device</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Changes to This Privacy Policy</h2>
    <p>We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. Any changes will be reflected with an updated "Last updated" date at the top of this page. We encourage you to review this Privacy Policy periodically for any changes.</p>

    <h2>Your Rights</h2>
    <p>Since Flimmersive does not collect or store any personal data externally, there is no data to access, modify, or delete from our end. All your data remains on your device under your control.</p>
